    <h1>The Petition of Rights (1628)</h1>
    <p>Having failed to intimidate Parliament, to raise taxes, to pay for his waning military budget, Charles I was forced to sign off on the Petition of Rights 1628, in return for Parliamentary support.</p>
    <p>The Petition of Rights 1628, though not the first instance of a right of a habeas corpus in English law, nonetheless, enshrined the principal of habeas corpus in the English Common Law.</p>
    <p>The Petition of Rights 1628, is a Constitutional document, forming part, and parcel of the unwritten Constitution of the United Kingdom.</p>
