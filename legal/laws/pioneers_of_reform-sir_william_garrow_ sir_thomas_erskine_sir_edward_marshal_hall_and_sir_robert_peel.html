    <h1>Pioneers of Reform: Sir William Garrow, Sir Thomas Erskine, Sir Edward Marshal Hall, and Sir Robert Peel</h1>
    <p>With statutes such as the Waltham Black Act 1723 making over 200 offenses punishable by death, and without access to a defense counsel, if you found yourself in the dock, your only source of legal counsel was the trial judge himself.</p>
    <p>Pius perjury, was when a jury would find an accused not guilty, or guilty of a lesser offense, not because they found the accused to be innocent, but because they knew the penalty was too harsh, and grossly disproportionate to the crime.</p>
    <p>Since the 13th Century inception of a legal profession, the role of a barrister had largely been limited to civil litigation. When, and how barristers came to represent defendants in criminal proceedings is still somewhat of a mystery. What is certain however, is that once barristers gained admittance in to the court rooms, they could not be evicted.</p>
    <p>A barrister could not in effect, directly address the jury, for to do so, would be to represent a defendant who was being prosecuted for, and on behalf of the Crown. Pioneers such as Sir William Garrow perfected the art of cross examination, where the case was no longer one of the evidence against the defendant, but a test of the evidence against the defendant. It was not sufficient for the evidence to merely support an indictment, the evidence had to prove the elements of the crime against the defendant.</p>
    <p>This was in line with the enlightenment of the age. Just as much as institutions such as The Royal Society were perfecting the scientific method, lawyers were perfecting rules of evidence to not only be admitted, but to be admissible.</p> 
    <p>Thus, what was once was a case of the evidence against a defendant, became a test of the evidence against the defendant. The defendant was deemed innocent until proven guilty. This presumption of innocence can largely be attributed to Sir William Garrow, who through the art of rhetoric, and vigorous cross examination, championed for a fair trial, and established the due process of the law.</p>
    <p>Note however, that where Sir William Garrow was more focused on the theatricality of the art of cross examination, Sir Thomas Erskine, defending Thomas Payne, and the Rights of Man, and Thomas Hardy of the London Corresponding Society, used a more calculated approach by expertly impeaching the credibility of prosecution witnesses, thereby rendering their evidence inadmissible.</p>
    <p>While Practitioners such as Sir William Garrow, and Sir Thomas Erskine were transforming the court room procedure, and the due process of the law from within, it was up to civil servants such as Sir Robert Peel to effect the substantive reform of the law, by consolidating laws, repealing what was antiquated, and irrelevant, and updating the statutes to reflect the contemporary needs of an evolving justice system.</p>
    <p>Having repealed the laws of the bloody code, Peel understood that a new deterrent against crime was needed. This came in the form of the metropolitan police force.</p>
    <p>Despite the great strides towards justice, defense counsel could still not directly address the jury. When convention did allow the barristers of the age to directly address the members of the jury, the contributions of Sri Edward Marshal Hall in his ‘summing up of evidence’ closing address to the jury, perhaps had the most profound effect of what the verdict of the jury came to be.</p>
    <p>In the defense of Robert Wood, in the Camden Town Murder, Sir Edward Marshal Hall not only used his gift of oratory, to cross examine the prosecution witnesses, and expertly impeaching their credibility, but took a daring stand, calling his own client as a witness. The defendant not only denied having committed the crime, but was proved to be incapable of it.</p>
