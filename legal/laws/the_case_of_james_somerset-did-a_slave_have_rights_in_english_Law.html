    <h1>The Case of James Somerset - Did a slave have rights in English Law?</h1>
    <p>James Somerset was an African slave, bought by Charles Stewart, and taken to Boston, Massachusetts. When his master returned to England, James Somerset accompanied him, and later escaped captivity, and found refuge amongst his fellow man. He was arrested, put on trial, and was to be deported.<p>
    <p>James Somerset however, had the backing of the abolitionist Granville Sharp. An appeal was made to Lord Mansfield CJ, who ruled that James Somerset had a right not to be detained without cause, and thus a right of habeas corpus. This landmark judgment in English law meant that a slave too had rights in the English Common Law.<p>
    <p>Note however that Lord Mansfield CJ, was in fact William Murray, the First Earl of Mansfield, whose nephew was Sir John Lindsey, whose issue was Dido Elizabeth Bell, from his union with an African slave. Dido Elizabeth Belle was in the care of Lord Mansfield, and it is said that Lord Mansfield was quite fond of his ward. Thus, his decision for James Somerset could have been influenced by personal circumstances, at home.</p>
