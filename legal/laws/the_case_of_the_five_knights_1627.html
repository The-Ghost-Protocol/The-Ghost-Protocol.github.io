    <h1>The Case of the Five Knights (1627)</h1>
    <p>In 1627, Charles I proposed crippling new taxes to pay for his waning military budget. When Parliament refused, he demanded loans from his richer subjects. Loans which they knew, will never be repaid. When they refused, Charles I used the military to invade their lands, and set up camp until they complied.</p> 
    <p>In the Case of the Five Knights (1627), five noble knights were imprisoned for refusing to extend a loan to the Crown. They contested their detention, and grounds of arrest. While the case itself was largely undecided, it was ruled that the King of England could in fact, invade his own territory.</p>
