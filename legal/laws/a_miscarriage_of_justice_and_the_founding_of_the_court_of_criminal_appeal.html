    <h1>A Miscarriage of Justice, and the Founding of the Court of Criminal Appeal</h1>
    <p>In a shocking case of mistaken identity, Adolf Beck, was convicted of fraud, for having swindled several women under the false identity Lord Wilton de Willoughby. Beck was innocent, and had a perfect alibi in South America when he was alleged to have been active in London. But despite his protest of his innocence, the law did not afford an opportunity for appeal. The popular press caught on, and rallied support for Beck. Eventually, he was released on parole, but only after serving five years of hard labour.</p> 
    <p>In the meantime, the real fraudster, John Meyer struck again, and was arrested. Beck was found innocent, but the damage had already been done. Despite a free pardon by the King, and compensation for false imprisonment, Beck died shortly thereafter, a broken man.</p>
    <p>Public outrage demanded legal reform, and in 1907, the Court of Criminal Appeal was founded, affording a right of appeal.</p>
