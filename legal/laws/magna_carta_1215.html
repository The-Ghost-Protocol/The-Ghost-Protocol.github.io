    <h1>Magna Carta (1215)</h1>
    <p>The Magana Carta, 1215 is perhaps the single most important legal document, in the history of the law. On the 15th of June 1215, at Runnymede, near Windsor, King John of England was forced to recognize the unalienable right of his people to the justice of the English Common Law. And since then, the Magna Carta has bound successive monarchies to this fundamental principal of the English Common Law. The Magna Carta, 1515 was cited at the Trial of Charles I in 1649, and was even the basis of the Universal Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, in 1776.</p>
