    <h1>The Benefit of Clergy</h1>
    <p><i>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:</i></p>
    <p><i>According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.</i></p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 51:1 KJV</strong></p>
    <p>One institution beyond the reach of the English Common Law was the Cannon Law of the Catholic Church. If found guilty, all that a cleric had to do was to recite Psalm 51:1, and he would be free of the English Common Law.</p>
    <p>The appointment of Thomas à Becket as the Archbishop of Canterbury was meant to rectify this, as Henry II sought out the help of Thomas à Becket to reign in criminous clerics. Thomas à Becket however, insisted in the supremacy of the Cannon Law, thereby running in to conflict with Henry II.</p>
    <p>While Henry II may indeed have uttered, “Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?” It is unlikely that he ordered the assassination of Thomas à Becket.</p>
    <p>On the 29th of December 1170, while Thomas à Becket was at vespers at Canterbury Cathedral, four Knights loyal to the King struck down Thomas à Becket, and killed him. Thomas à Becket became a martyr, and Henry II gave up contesting the Cannon Law.</p>
    <p>Thomas à Becket’s legacy has plagued the Catholic Church ever since. Every time a cleric were to abuse their position, and claim the benefit of clergy, the Church has come under increasing scrutiny to revise the Cannon Law, to be in line with the secular laws of State.</p>
