    <h1>The High Court of Justice (1649) – The Trial of King Charles I</h1>
    <p>The High Court of Justice (1649), was established to try Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland. It was a war crimes trial, where Charles I not only refused to plead, accepting guilt, but insisted on the Divine Right of Kings, asking "I would know by what power I am called hither. I would know by what authority, I mean lawful authority?"</p>
    <p>During his trial, it is said that he repeatedly struck the prosecutor John Cook on the back, using the tip of his cane, which fell off, forcing Charles I to kneel, to pick it up. This moment has been interpreted as the King submitting himself before the law.</p>
    <p>In the case of R v. R, John Cook reasoned that it was the person of the King that was on trial, and not the institution of the Crown.</p>
    <p>Charles I was found guilty, and was publicly executed by beheading on the 30th of January, 1649. After the restoration monarchy, Charles II had John Cook prosecuted for high treason, and regicide. He was found guilty, and was hanged, drawn and quartered.</p>
