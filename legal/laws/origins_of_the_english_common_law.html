    <h1>Origins of the English Common Law</h1>
    <p>The early compensation culture found in the Textus Roffensis was meant to replace blood feuds, which was the default mode of justice when a wrong had been committed. Æthelberht of Kent understood that the greatest threat to the stability of his Kingdom was not external, but internal. This an attempt was made to lay down the law, where for a given offence, of certain magnitude, a predefined penalty was exacted.</p>
    <p>With the introduction of the Hundred, and Shire Courts, the preferred mode of justice was trial on oath. Where evidence was on oath, and with a contingency of oath helpers. To lie on oath, would have been to risk eternal damnation. And to support an oath not made in good faith would have risked one’s standing in society. This was a simple, but effective way of justice.</p>
    <p>Eventually trial by ordeal became the test of evidence. In trial by fire, you would have had to hold a red hot iron in hand, and walk a few paces. Your hand would then be bandaged, and allowed to heal. If your wounds were healing, you were innocent. If they were to have turned foul, and fester, you were guilty.</p>
    <p>In trial by water, you would have been bound, and lowered in to a body of sanctified water. The water was assumed to be so pure, so as to repel sin. Thus, sinking meant you were innocent, and floating meant you were guilty.</p>
    <p>With the Norman conquest 1066, trial by combat, which was the preferred mode of trial on the continent, was used. If you were innocent, and you lost, you would have been deemed to have committed major acts of perjury.  If you were guilty, and you lost, the other side would carry out the sentence in to execution.</p>
    <p>In 1215, Pope Innocent III decreed that the judicium dei, or the judgement of god, was not at the beck and call of mere mortals. Thus trail by ordeal was ruled out. On the continent, this was replaced by the Catholic Inquisition, which established the inquisitorial trial, where confessions were sometimes extorted through torture, if it were necessary. In England, a radical shift was made. Wherefore, the test of innocence, or guilt was to be decided by members of a jury. Thus, in the tradition of the English Common Law, the individual was, and has always been at the heart of the judicial process. This meant that the trial was a test of evidence, and the parties would contest this as adversaries. I. e. the adversarial trial.</p>
