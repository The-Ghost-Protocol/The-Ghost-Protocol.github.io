    <h1>The English Common Law and the Royal Prerogative</h1>
    <p>The Royal Prerogative represents powers of administration, and governance, vested in the Crown. From the late 15th, to the mid 17th Centuries, the Royal Prerogative came to be exercised from out of the Court of Star Chamber, at the Palace of Westminster, in London.</p>
    <p>It was originally an institution founded to fight bribery, and corruption, whereby errant aristocrats who could bribe, and intimidate juries could not buy their way out of the Court of Star Chamber, where there were no juries, and you were tried by select members from out of the Government itself.</p>
    <p>King Charles I (1625 to 1649), perverted the Court of Star Chamber, and used its institutions to exercise the Royal Prerogative beyond the interests of the English Common Law. Eventually, Charles I had to dissolve the Court of Star Chamber, in return for Parliamentary support.</p>
