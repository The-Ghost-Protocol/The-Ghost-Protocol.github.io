    <h1>John Lilburne and the Fight for Civil Liberties</h1>
    <p>During the Interregnum of Oliver Cromwell, and the Commonwealth, civil liberties were being abused, and exploited. John Lilburne used the power of the printing press to incite dissidence. He was repeatedly arrested, and each time he was detained, he would call on the Petition of Rights 1628, and a writ of habeas corpus would set him free.</p> 
    <p>Eventually, a new law made publications against the State a crime of high treason. Lilburn was arrested, and was put on trial. At his trial he represented himself, expertly referencing the law, and calling on precedents. After a long and arduous trial that involved the use of chamber pot in the middle of session, John Lilburne was found not guilty, and was set free.</p>
    <p>He was again arrested, and this time removed to Mont Orgueil Castle on the Island of Jersey. Mont Orgueil Castle was the 17th Century equivalent of Guantanamo Bay, and away from the jurisdiction of the English Common Law, John Lilburne could not seek out a writ of habeas corpus. His cell was exposed to the elements, and on the 29th of August, 1657, John Lilburne died of health conditions exacerbated by the conditions of his detention, and imprisonment.</p>
