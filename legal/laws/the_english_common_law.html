    <h1>The English Common Law</h1>
    <p>With the death of William Adelin, the only legitimate son of Henry I, in the White Ship disaster of 1120, the line of succession was disputed. Henry sought out to be succeeded by his daughter Empress Matilda, wife of Henry V Holy Roman Emperor (m. 1114; died 1125), and of Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou (m. 1128; died 1151), but he could not convince the nobility of this. When Henry died, he was succeed by his nephew Stephen de Blois, and England plunged in to a period of anarchy between 1138 and 1153.</p> 
    <p>When Henry II succeeded to the throne, the institutions of English law were all but in ruin. Juries of presentment were established to report to the Crown offences as were committed in the Hundreds, and the Shires, and the rowing Royal Justices were dispatched from out of Westminster to adjudicate. Soon it was found that there were inconsistencies in the case records. Which meant that either the laws were not effective, or the laws were not common. Thus, Henry II standardized the laws of England and Wales, founding the English Common Law.</p>
